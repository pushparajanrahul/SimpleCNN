# SimpleCNN
This repository contains a simple CNN model, trained on MNIST Dataset, and this excercie is actively done by a lot of DL enthusiasts/begineers and is even considered as an indroductory excercise for Image processing courses. I am lending the same concept but I will try to comprehend the example with step by step guidance on how to build the algorithm i.e., the Simple CNN architecture and utilize it for training a Dataset (MNIST Dataset in this case). 

NOTE : If you couldn't understand any terminology given below, please take some time to Google the definition in the context of ML/DL, for a better clarity.

# Lets Talk about Dataset - The MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset primarily consist of about 70,000 handwritten numeric images and their respective labels marked to it. Out of the total, 60,000 images are that of training images and 10,000 are test images, 
all of which are of the dimension 28pixel by 28pixel. 

MNIST dataset is monochromatic, featuring a sole color channel, in contrast to the RGB color format, which makes the number of channels as 1 instead on 3 (for RGB images).

Below is a sample of MNIST Dataset.
